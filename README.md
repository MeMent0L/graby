Takes crypto-currency tracking data from coinmarketcap.northpole.ro and saves it in a tab-delimited .txt file

Requires urllib2, json and tabulate

Copied/modified from https://github.com/abitfan/coinmarketcap-cli


Next step would be to store the data in a SQL database. Any ideas & contributions welcomed!
